            Classes and competitions can be intense so it's important we allow
            ourselves time to relax in good company. Our Social Secretaries
            ensure social events are a regular occurrence, with emphasis on
            meeting new people and building a second family for everyone
            involved.

            The most popular social event at Warwick is called 'Circling' and is
            usually followed by POP! in the Copper Rooms (the SU's night out
            event). We attend a couple of these events per term, usually with a
            fun dress-up theme to follow. The nature of these events have come
            into question recently, however, we assure you that the safety and
            well-being of participants is our highest priority. We DO NOT and
            WILL NOT pressure, coerce or guilt anyone into drinking behaviours
            they are uncomfortable with, and a sober Exec member is always
            present.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also have plenty of fun sober socials throughout the year which
            offer students a space to relax and do something fun together. Our
            favourites have included a trip to Birmingham Christmas Market, a
            Murder Mystery written by a member of our Exec and a brunch at the
            beginning of Term 1.
