            At Warwick Latin & Ballroom we pride ourselves in giving back to the
            community and charities, and we actively encourage members to get
            involved. Aside from our annual Warwick does Strictly and Charity
            Week, we have held smaller fundraising events such as a charity Quiz
            Night in aid of Myton Hospice. We are keen to expand our efforts to
            include volunteering for charities and community projects.

            In 2019 we supported the Helping Hands Community Project by
            fundraising during our Christmas classes and donating Christmas shoe
            boxes.

            We find it very enjoyable and rewarding to get involved with
            charities. If you have any questions regarding the causes we
            support, how to get involved, or anything else please don't hesitate
            to get in touch with our Vice President and Welfare Officer.
